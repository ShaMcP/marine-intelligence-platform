## Environmental & Phytoplankton Data

### Satellite-Derived Ocean Data
- Sea surface temperature
- Chlorophyll concentration
- Ocean colour indicators

**Purpose:**
Used to analyse environmental conditions linked to ecosystem health and
phytoplankton abundance.

---

### Phytoplankton & Ecosystem Data
- Species-level or group-level plankton observations
- Bloom frequency and density (where available)

**Purpose:**
Provides insight into primary productivity and its relationship with climate
change and marine life behaviour.

## Animal Movement Data

### Whale Migration Data
- Timestamped location tracking
- Species-level movement patterns

**Purpose:**
Used to understand migration routes and behavioural changes in response to
environmental conditions.

---

### Shark Movement Data
- Tagged movement data with geospatial coordinates

**Purpose:**
Supports analysis of predator behaviour and ecosystem balance.
